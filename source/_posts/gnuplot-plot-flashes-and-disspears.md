##### When I run gnuplot from the shell or a script, the resulting plot flashes by on the screen and then disappears

1. Put a pause -1 after the plot command in the file, or at the file end.
2. Use command gnuplot filename.gp - (yes, dash is the last parameter) to stay in the interactive  regime when the script completes.
3. Run gnuplot as gnuplot -persist
4. On Windows you can also use either -persist or /noend.
5. Give the persist option as part of the set terminal command.
