##### Question:

  I suppose Perl has a REPL for some simple inputs, but there is not. So I wonder is there a interactive form within Perl itself or I must install some other add-in or REPL programs for Perl.

##### Answer:
	
```perl
	perl -de1

```perl
	perl -d -e 1
```
	There also some external implements for Perl`s REPL. Look at reference:
